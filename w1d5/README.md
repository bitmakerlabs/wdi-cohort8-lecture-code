As a user...
I should be able to...
So that...


- As a user, I should be able to add, edit and delete a contact
- As a user, I should be able to list all of the contacts
- As a user, I should be able to track my relationship to a customer
- As a user, I should be able to group contacts
- As a user, I should be able to search so that I can find a particular contact
- As a user, when I type user information it should autocomplete so that it's easier to find people
